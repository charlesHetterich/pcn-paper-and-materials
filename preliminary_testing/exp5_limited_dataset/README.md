# Experiment 5: Limited Dataset

The initial question was: can a PCN extract more real signal from a limited dataset than an FCN. This is tested on a subset of the MNIST dataset, consisting of 100 training samples. We compare against the full validation set of 10k samples.

We test FCN's & PCN's of various sizes.

Initial results do not seem to be promising, so we will not continue this experiment further for now.
